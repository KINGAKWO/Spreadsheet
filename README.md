# Functional Programming Spreadsheet

This project is a simple spreadsheet built using functional programming principles. The spreadsheet is rendered in a grid layout, with each cell containing an input field. The user can enter a formula in any cell, and the result of the formula will be displayed in the cell.

The spreadsheet is built using the following technologies:

* JavaScript: Used for the logic of the spreadsheet, including the formula evaluation and the rendering of the grid.
* HTML: Used for the structure of the spreadsheet, including the grid layout and the input fields.
* CSS: Used for the styling of the spreadsheet, including the layout and the appearance of the input fields.

The goals of this project are:

* To create a functional programming spreadsheet that is easy to use and understand.
* To demonstrate the benefits of using functional programming principles in a real-world application.
* To provide a simple and intuitive interface for users to enter and evaluate formulas.
* To make the spreadsheet extensible, so that new features and functions can be easily added.
